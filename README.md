# Hodges Status Column Data Validation Script

Purpose of the code is to ensure that a particular "Status" column in csv files only contains 0's or 1's. 

You must install Python to run the script, if you do not use the executable (available for download under the "Releases" section). 

If running the script in the terminal, enter Python, then file path that .py file containing script is located at and run by pressing "Enter".
